# Cloud-based iOS Building Setup Guide

Your REDash app is now configured for cloud-based iOS building! Here are your options:

## üöÄ Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended - Free)

### What it does:
- Automatically builds your iOS app when you push code to GitHub
- Uses GitHub's free macOS runners (2,000 minutes/month free)
- No need for a Mac computer
- Builds both debug and release versions

### Setup Steps:

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with iOS setup"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/redash-app.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:
   - Install dependencies
   - Build your React app
   - Set up Capacitor and iOS platform
   - Build the iOS app
   - Upload the build artifacts

3. **Download your iOS app**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Actions" tab
   - Click on the latest workflow run
   - Download the "ios-build" artifact

### For App Store Distribution:
To build for the App Store, you'll need to add Apple Developer certificates to GitHub Secrets:
- `IOS_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`: Your distribution certificate
- `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: Certificate password
- `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`: Your provisioning profile

## üåê Option 2: Expo Application Services (EAS)

### What it does:
- Cloud-based building service by Expo
- Handles certificates and provisioning automatically
- Direct App Store submission
- $29/month for unlimited builds

### Setup Steps:

1. **Create Expo account**: https://expo.dev
2. **Install EAS CLI**: `npm install -g @expo/eas-cli`
3. **Login**: `eas login`
4. **Configure**: `eas build:configure`
5. **Build**: `eas build --platform ios`

## üì± Option 3: Codemagic (Alternative)

### What it does:
- Specialized mobile CI/CD platform
- Free tier available (500 build minutes/month)
- Automatic App Store deployment
- Easy certificate management

### Setup Steps:
1. Sign up at https://codemagic.io
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure iOS build settings
4. Add Apple Developer credentials
5. Trigger builds automatically or manually

## üéØ Recommended Approach

**Start with GitHub Actions** because:
- ‚úÖ Free (2,000 minutes/month)
- ‚úÖ Integrated with your code repository
- ‚úÖ No additional accounts needed
- ‚úÖ Full control over build process
- ‚úÖ Easy to debug and customize

**Upgrade to EAS later** if you need:
- More frequent builds
- Automatic certificate management
- Direct App Store submission
- Advanced build features

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub** to trigger the first build
2. **Test the build process** by checking the Actions tab
3. **Download and test** the generated iOS app file
4. **Add Apple Developer certificates** when ready for App Store submission

Your monthly push notifications are now fully configured and will work automatically once the iOS app is built and installed on devices!
