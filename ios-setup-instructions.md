# iOS App Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
Before you can build your iOS app, you'll need:

1. **Mac computer** - iOS development requires macOS
2. **Xcode** - Download from the Mac App Store (free)
3. **Apple Developer Account** - Required for App Store distribution ($99/year)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Build and Add iOS Platform
```bash
# Build your React app and sync with Capacitor
npm run build:mobile

# Add iOS platform (run this only once)
npx cap add ios
```

### 2. Open in Xcode
```bash
# This will open your project in Xcode
npm run ios
```

### 3. Configure in Xcode
When Xcode opens:

1. **Select your development team**:
   - Click on the project name in the left sidebar
   - Under "Signing & Capabilities", select your Apple Developer team
   - Xcode will automatically generate a bundle identifier

2. **Configure app settings**:
   - App name: REDash
   - Bundle ID: com.redash.app (or your custom domain)
   - Version: 1.0.0

3. **Test on simulator**:
   - Select an iOS simulator from the device dropdown
   - Click the "Play" button to build and run

### 4. Test on Physical Device
1. Connect your iPhone via USB
2. Select your device from the dropdown
3. Click "Play" to install and run on your device

### 5. Build for App Store
```bash
# Build optimized version for distribution
npm run ios:build
```

Then in Xcode:
1. Select "Any iOS Device" from the device dropdown
2. Go to Product â†’ Archive
3. Follow the upload process to App Store Connect

## Important Notes

- **First build takes time**: The initial iOS build can take 10-15 minutes
- **Simulator vs Device**: Test on both simulator and real device
- **App Store Review**: Apple reviews all apps before they go live (1-7 days)
- **Updates**: When you update your React code, run `npm run build:mobile` to sync changes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Clean build folder: Product â†’ Clean Build Folder in Xcode
2. Reset Capacitor: `npx cap sync ios --force`
3. Check Capacitor docs: https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios
